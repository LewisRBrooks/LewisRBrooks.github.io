      <h3>Lewis Brooks</h3>
      <p> Hi, I'm Lewis Brooks, I have begun my undergraduate degree in Computer Science, for the first 2 weeks we have practiced java. Despite programming for a few years before on python, java is an entirely different language and allows for much more freedom in terms of coding, UI, and processing. 
	  Currently I am in the RAF Air Cadets, and I'm interested in graphic design and cyber security and hope to enter the industry once I've got my degree.
	  I have previously worked on a Battleships Game in python for A Level Computer Science and have worked with programming language such as html, css and python on and off for 5 years
	  <br><br>
	  Until then I will be showcasing my work on this portfolio and recording my progression and skills learnt in my time at City, University of London.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: AudioCube</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City, University of London. This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of variables, loops, 3d graphics, transforming, rotation as well as sound processing. I created a 3D box using nested for loops, and using the Sound library from Processing was able to input songs and analyze them using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analyzer and outputting the results to 
	alter the depth of the shapes. User can also interact with the program using the keyboard via [SPACE] for pausing and playing, and Number Keys, [1, 2, 3] to choose which song to play and visualise.
